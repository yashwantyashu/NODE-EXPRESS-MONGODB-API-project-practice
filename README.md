Node - express - mongodb API backend project followed by Devtamin API tutorial for learning.
Used nodejs, expressjs, nodemon,cors,mongoose,mongodb and insomnia for api testing
This is a basic API project to get to know how backend with node,express and mongodb works with http methods, mvc architecture implementation,cors implementation and middleware
This was coded along while watching the tutorial with comments for further reference and learning in future on a later read or to reuse with a frontend application
to start with this project
install node modules by command npm i
then create a cluster in mongodb and connect with it
copy the shell url in cluster atlas page to the mongodb in env file
then save and run the application with npm run dev
open insomnia or any preferred api testing tool and copy paste the localhost url to try out with http methods
once created in the api tool, the data can be seen in the mongodb database on clicking refresh
